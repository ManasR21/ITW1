## Overview

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) play vital roles in network security by monitoring and responding to malicious activities. This section delves into the distinctions between IDS and IPS, deployment strategies, and effective configurations.

### Key Subtopics

#### Signature-based vs. Anomaly-based Detection:

- Compare and contrast signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection in IDS/IPS systems.
- Discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach and scenarios where they excel.

#### Honeypots:

- Introduce the concept of honeypots and their use in detecting and analyzing cyber threats.
- Explain how integrating honeypots with IDS/IPS systems enhances overall security.

#### Incident Response Integration:

- Explore how IDS/IPS systems fit into an incident response plan.
- Provide best practices for leveraging IDS/IPS data during incident handling.
