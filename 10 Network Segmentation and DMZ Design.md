## Overview

Network segmentation enhances security and manageability by dividing a network into smaller segments. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a critical component of network security. This section covers segmentation strategies, DMZ design, and their roles in securing networks.

### Key Subtopics

#### Micro-Segmentation:

- Explore micro-segmentation as an advanced strategy for enhancing security within network segments.
- Discuss use cases and benefits of implementing micro-segmentation.

#### Zero Trust Networking:

- Discuss the principles of Zero Trust Networking and its relevance to network segmentation.
- Explain how adopting a Zero Trust model improves overall network security.

#### DMZ Configuration Examples:

- Provide practical examples of DMZ configurations for web servers, email servers, and other services.
- Explain the rationale behind DMZ design choices in different scenarios.
