## Overview

Subnetting is a fundamental practice for efficient IP network management. Proper subnetting and IP addressing schemes contribute to a well-organized and scalable network. This section covers subnetting, IP address allocation, and addressing strategies.

### Key Subtopics

#### Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM):

- Explain how VLSM allows subnets of different sizes within the same network.
- Provide examples of VLSM in addressing complex network requirements.

#### IPv6 Subnetting:

- Cover subnetting in IPv6, highlighting similarities and differences with IPv4.
- Discuss the advantages of IPv6 subnetting and address allocation.

#### Addressing Best Practices:

- Share best practices for IP addressing, including proper documentation and allocation planning.
- Provide guidelines for designing scalable and easy-to-manage IP addressing schemes.
